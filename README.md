hi :wave:, I'm Bane! I'm an R&D Engineer [@Kitware](https://github.com/Kitware) working at the intersection of geoscience, visualization, and data science.

I'm a geophysicist/hydrologist by training and I've found my niche in open-source software development. Check out the following pinned projects to see some of the work I am most eager to share!
