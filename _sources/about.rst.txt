About
=====

My background is primarily in applied earth sciences, earning a B.Sc. in Geophysics and an M.Sc. in Hydrological Science from the Colorado School of Mines.
Through my graduate research, I explored the intersection of 3D visualization, geoscience, and reproducible workflows.
My focus has been helping geoscientists visualize their 3D/4D data, communicate their spatial findings, and enable data traceability in their research.
These efforts lead me to create geovisualization and data management software to streamline reproducible computing workflows in the geosciences, particularly the `PyVista software <https://www.pyvista.org>`_.

I am most proud of my contributions to `PyVista <https://www.pyvista.org>`_, an open-source Python package for 3D visualization and spatial data analysis.
Beyond PyVista, I am an active contributor to many open-source geoscience software, and I am always looking for ways to make an impact in my work.
I genuinely believe that scientific findings should be reproducible, not only by other researchers but also by stakeholders of the science at hand; I carry this sentiment in my efforts to develop research software.

Beyond all the coding and science, I'm an avid rock climber, runner, and general human-powered adventure enthusiast! When I'm not coding up super cool 3D visualization software, you can find me trail running or climbing.

Please feel free to reach out to me! I am happy to talk about anything in the realm of earth science computing, open-source research software, or epic outdoor activities.
